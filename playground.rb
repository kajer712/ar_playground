# if you have not installed the needed gems, please do the following:
# gem install sqlite3
# gem install activerecord

require "sqlite3"
require "active_record"

# this line configures ActiveRecord to connect to a sqlite3 database in the same folder named "students.sqlite3"
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(:adapter => "sqlite3", :database => "./students.sqlite3")

# This sets up ActiveRecord to use Ruby OOP with SQL data
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base
end

# Write your test code here

# 1. Create a new student using new and save
student = Student.new(name: "John Snow")
student.save
# 2. Create a new student using create

# 3. Select all students
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?

# Why can't you do Student.name or Student.email?

# 4. Select the first student
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?

# 5. Select the last student
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it a Student object or Active Record relation object?

# 6. Use each to iterate through the #<ActiveRecord::Relation> object to display the name of each student

# 7. Find student by the name Dr. Lois Pfeff using where.
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it the Student object or Active Record relation object?

# What will the following return to you? (remember to comment out the code!)
# p student.id
# p student.name
# p student.email
# p student.age


# 8. Find student by name using find_by
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it the Student object or Active Record relation object?

# What will the following return to you?
# p student.id
# p student.name
# p student.email
# p student.age

# Do research on the difference between "where" and "find_by".

# 9. Find the student with id = 7 using find and find_by
# pay attention to the object that is returned to you, is it the User object or Active Record relation object?


# 10. Update information for student with id = 5 using student.email and save. Change the student's email to elsie@example.com

# 11. Now use update to update this student's age to 21.

# 12. Delete student with id 21 using delete

# 13. Delete student with id 22 using destroy
